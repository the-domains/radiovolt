            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Techies Project by Photographer Helena Price</h1><p>The two words "Silicon Valley" immediately stir up stereotypes, stigma and maybe an HBO show. The name has become a cultural reflex, and that's what photographer Helena Price wants to change with her ambitious, large-scale portrait and interview series. Techies Project, launched today, is a collection of 100 in-depth interviews that breaks this idea of the "sameness" plaguing the area.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7265c5abd944ed7ad3fdd9c9b6270021b13537b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>
